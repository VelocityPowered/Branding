# Velocity Branding

This repository contains a selection of logos used by the Velocity project.
We want to make sure use of our assets are positive, so we kindly request
that you follow the guidelines in the next section. If you're unsure, please
[join our Discord](https://discord.gg/8cB9Bgf) and let's talk.

Unlike the rest of the Velocity project, these logos are all rights reserved.

## Usage directions

SVG and PNG versions of our logos are available. All have been optimized (with svgo
for SVGs and pngquant+optipng for the PNGs).

Please do not edit, recolor, rearrange, or distort the Velocity logo. Resizing the
logo and cropping out any blank space is acceptable.

The logo should not be used in a matter that suggests the Velocity project officially
endorses some product or service. For instance, you may advertise a plugin as being
compatible with Velocity, but you may not make the Velocity logo prominent in that
advertising.
